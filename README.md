# HIIT Generator
This is my submission for Codecademy's Mixed Messages portfolio project.
This program generates a HIIT workout for any user who runs it.
## What is HIIT?
HIIT stands for High-Intensity Interval Training. This type of workout comprises of short intervals of high intensity exercise that elicit 85%-95% max heart rate with recovery periods in between.<br>
There are many different paradigms of HIIT, and this program will generate a HIIT workout that follows the "4 x 4" regimen which requires four intervals of high-intensity exercise that ellicits 85-95% max heart rate with periods of recovery in between.
## What does a HIIT workout look like?
A HIIT workout that follows the 4 x 4 regimen may look like:
- Warm Up (10 min)
1. First interval (1 min): Burpees
   - Active recovery (2 min)
2. Second interval (1 min): Rope Whips
   - Active recovery (2 min)
3. Third interval (1 min): Plank
   - Active recovery (2 min)
4. Fourth interval (1 min): High Knees
   - Active recovery (2 min)
- Cool Down <br><br>

This is just one example of what HIIT can look like. There are many other variations of HIIT workouts that have more or less intervals that may vary in duration.
## The Benefits of HIIT
1. Helps to burn a lot of calories in a short amount of time
2. Increases the metabolic rate even after the workout
3. Helps to burn fat
4. May result in muscle gain
5. Improves oxygen consumption
6. Reduces heart rate and blood pressure
